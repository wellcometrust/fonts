# ✒️ Wellcome Fonts

This is a repository of publicly available Wellcome fonts.

### Usage via CORS

When loading these fonts on your website directly from GitHub, you will almost certainly need to account for [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) limitations. 

One way to get around this is [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/), which will create a proxy link for you with the correct HTTP headers.
